## Components

In a Next.js project, components are reusable building blocks of the user interface (UI). Components are typically stored in the `components/` directory, and they help break down the UI into smaller, maintainable parts.

## Component Organization
- **Presentational Components**: Focus only on how things look (UI). These components receive data via props and don't manage state.
- **Container Components**: Handle logic and state. They pass data to presentational components.
- **Reusable Components**: Components like buttons, form elements, or modals that can be used across multiple pages to maintain consistency and avoid repetition.
